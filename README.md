## Description
Challenge 14 coursework for UT bootcamp. Uses Handlebars, Sequelize, 'express-sessions', and Heroku. </br>
This is a full-stack application for a tech blog, where the user can view posts and comments from </br>
other users, and login to create their own posts and comments. The logged-in user can also </br>
comment on other posts, and update their own posts/comments. They can also log out, or be  </br>
logged out after a set amount of time has passed. </br>

## What I Have Learned
I've formed a good foundation for MVC structure, route creations, connections between files, </br>
seeding the database, and understanding how to have JavaScript files interact with Handlebars. </br>
All of this newfound knowledge leading up to the creation of a full-stack application. </br>
